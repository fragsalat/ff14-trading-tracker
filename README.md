# Final Fantasy 14 - Trading Tracker 

This tool aims to support on trading actions and to keep an eye on profit. You can track what you bought 
on market for which amount and price and later track for what you sold it. This is especially useful
when buying multiple stacks for different prices but selling the pieces one by one.

This tool also provides you a graph of paid, earned and total profit on a weekly basis.
When you filter for a item name the table will be filtered and the graph also just shows
the data for the filtered result.
